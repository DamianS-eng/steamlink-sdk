.SH NAME
IMG_Quit \- Deinitialize SDL_image\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_image/SDL_image\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_image/SDL_image.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void IMG_Quit(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This should be the last function you call in SDL_image, after freeing all
other resources\[char46] This will unload any shared libraries it is using for
various codecs\[char46]

After this call, a call to 
.BR IMG_Init
(0) will return 0 (no codecs
loaded)\[char46]

You can safely call 
.BR IMG_Init
() to reload various codec support
after this call\[char46]

Unlike other SDL satellite libraries, calls to 
.BR IMG_Init
 do not
stack; a single call to 
.BR IMG_Quit
() will deinitialize everything
and does not have to be paired with a matching 
.BR IMG_Init
 call\[char46]
For that reason, it's considered best practices to have a single

.BR IMG_Init
 and 
.BR IMG_Quit
 call in your program\[char46] While
this isn't required, be aware of the risks of deviating from that behavior\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_image 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
