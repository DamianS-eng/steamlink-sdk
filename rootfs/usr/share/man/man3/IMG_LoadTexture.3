.TH IMG_LoadTexture 3 "SDL_image 3.0.0" "SDL_image" "SDL_image3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
IMG_LoadTexture \- Load an image from a filesystem path into a GPU texture\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_image/SDL_image\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_image/SDL_image.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_Texture * IMG_LoadTexture(SDL_Renderer *renderer, const char *file);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
An SDL_Texture represents an image in GPU memory, usable by SDL's 2D Render
API\[char46] This can be significantly more efficient than using a CPU-bound
SDL_Surface if you don't need to manipulate the image directly after
loading it\[char46]

If the loaded image has transparency or a colorkey, a texture with an alpha
channel will be created\[char46] Otherwise, SDL_image will attempt to create an
SDL_Texture in the most format that most reasonably represents the image
data (but in many cases, this will just end up being 32-bit RGB or 32-bit
RGBA)\[char46]

There is a separate function to read files from an SDL_IOStream, if you
need an i/o abstraction to provide data from anywhere instead of a simple
filesystem read; that function is

.BR IMG_LoadTexture_IO
()\[char46]

If you would rather decode an image to an SDL_Surface (a buffer of pixels
in CPU memory), call 
.BR IMG_Load
() instead\[char46]

When done with the returned texture, the app should dispose of it with a
call to SDL_DestroyTexture()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I renderer
the SDL_Renderer to use to create the GPU texture\[char46]
.TP
.I file
a path on the filesystem to load an image from\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a new texture, or NULL on error\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_image 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
