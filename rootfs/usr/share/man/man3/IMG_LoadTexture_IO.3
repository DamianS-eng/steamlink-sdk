.SH NAME
IMG_LoadTexture_IO \- Load an image from an SDL data source into a GPU texture\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_image/SDL_image\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_image/SDL_image.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_Texture * IMG_LoadTexture_IO(SDL_Renderer *renderer, SDL_IOStream *src, SDL_bool closeio);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
An SDL_Texture represents an image in GPU memory, usable by SDL's 2D Render
API\[char46] This can be significantly more efficient than using a CPU-bound
SDL_Surface if you don't need to manipulate the image directly after
loading it\[char46]

If the loaded image has transparency or a colorkey, a texture with an alpha
channel will be created\[char46] Otherwise, SDL_image will attempt to create an
SDL_Texture in the most format that most reasonably represents the image
data (but in many cases, this will just end up being 32-bit RGB or 32-bit
RGBA)\[char46]

If
.BR closeio
is SDL_TRUE,
.BR src
will be closed before returning, whether
this function succeeds or not\[char46] SDL_image reads everything it needs from
.BR src
during this call in any case\[char46]

There is a separate function to read files from disk without having to deal
with SDL_IOStream:
.BR IMG_LoadTexture(renderer, "filename\[char46]jpg")
will call
this function and manage those details for you, determining the file type
from the filename's extension\[char46]

There is also 
.BR IMG_LoadTextureTyped_IO
(), which
is equivalent to this function except a file extension (like "BMP", "JPG",
etc) can be specified, in case SDL_image cannot autodetect the file format\[char46]

If you would rather decode an image to an SDL_Surface (a buffer of pixels
in CPU memory), call 
.BR IMG_Load
() instead\[char46]

When done with the returned texture, the app should dispose of it with a
call to SDL_DestroyTexture()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I renderer
the SDL_Renderer to use to create the GPU texture\[char46]
.TP
.I src
an SDL_IOStream that data will be read from\[char46]
.TP
.I closeio
SDL_TRUE to close/free the SDL_IOStream before returning, SDL_FALSE to leave it open\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a new texture, or NULL on error\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_image 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
