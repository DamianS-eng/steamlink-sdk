.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This halts any currently-playing music, and next time the music stream is
played, SDL_mixer will spawn a process using the command line specified in
.BR command
\[char46] This command is not subject to shell expansion, and beyond some
basic splitting up of arguments, is passed to execvp() on most platforms,
not system()\[char46]

The command is responsible for generating sound; it is NOT mixed by
SDL_mixer! SDL_mixer will kill the child process if asked to halt the
music, but otherwise does not have any control over what the process does\[char46]

You are strongly encouraged not to use this function without an extremely
good reason\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
